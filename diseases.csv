Mosaic Virus,"Mosaic viruses can be seed borne or soil borne and are spread by sap sucking insects such as aphids. They can also be spread by contact of infected plants, and are most problematic in dry weather.",Green and yellow mottled leaves | Prickly or bumpy surface on fruits | Stunted growth | Low pepper production,"Remove affected plants. There are no effective treatments for viruses. If you suspect mosaic virus, remove the pepper plants from the garden and burn them if possible. The fruits are still safe to eat, but the seeds can carry the virus, so do not save seeds from affected fruits. Keep the pests at bay. Mosaic viruses are commonly spread by sap sucking insects such as aphids. Use a pure neem oil solution with castile soap and water and spray plants to deal with these pests. | Keep the weeds under control. Weeds can carry mosaic virus, and can also be a breeding ground for the insects that spread it. Use a ground cover, or at least keep the weeds at bay with a weeding hoe (these are great for saving your back). | Avoid touching plants. Always wash your hands before and after gardening. Your hands can be the vehicle to transfer viral pathogens from one plant to another. Also, avoid smoking in your garden, as this can introduce mosaic virus to the soil. | Plant resistant pepper varieties. Some varieties have been identified to be more resistant to tobacco mosaic virus, though none are resistant to cucumber mosaic and other viruses. Look for varieties that are labeled 'TMV' (tobacco mosaic virus resistant) at nurseries and garden centers. Some common types are sweet banana, super cayenne, and bell boy hybrid.",https://peppergeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Mosaic-Virus-Pepper-Plant-sm.jpg.webp
Blight,"Phytophthora blight is a pepper plant disease that is spread by a soil-borne pathogen. If your pepper plants have leaves low on the main stem, the rainfall can cause the soil to splash up on to the foliage, introducing the disease. | There are more than one type of blight, usually categorized into 'early blight' and 'late blight.' Symptoms are similar, but some are more common in different parts of the world at different times of the growing season.","Large, brown leaf spots and wilting | Brown or black stems at base of plant | Root rot (leading to plant death) | Fruit rot (when in contact with infected soil)","Plant your peppers in a raised bed or in pots to improve drainage. Blight is most commonly found in in-ground gardens or fields. Rainfall will have less time to sit on the surface of the soil and spread the pathogen in a raised bed or a potted plant. | If you can't use a raised bed or pot, try mounding up the soil around each plant to avoid standing water at the base of the plants. | Another step to take is to use a mulch, such as straw, grass clippings, or black tarp. Mulching helps prevent splashing from the soil onto your pepper plant's leaves when it rains. It also has other benefits like improved water retention and subduing weeds. | If it is dry, do not over-water your garden. Standing water is the only way that blight mold spores can multiply and spread. Wherever the infected water flows, the spores will follow. | Always acquire your soil and/or compost from trustworthy sources. Bringing infected soil into the garden is the easiest way to end up with this pepper plant problem.",https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_620+q_lossless+ret_img+to_webp/https://doraagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/early-blight.jpg
Bacterial Leaf Spot,"Bacterial leaf spot is a common bacterial plant infection seen all around the world. It is most common in rainy, humid, and temperate climates. These are the environmental conditions in which the bacteria can spread most easily. | Leaf spot is a bacteria, so it can be spread by touch, through seeds, or via soil. Use cleanly soil and watering practices to avoid splashing the leaves with soil or cross contaminating.","Yellow and green spots on leaves | Brown spots on leaves in later stages | Raised, corky spots on peppers | Leaf drop and decaying peppers","Remove infected parts. As with pepper plants infected with viruses, you should remove parts of the plant that show signs of leaf spot. The bacteria can spread easily, especially under damp and hot conditions. You don't need to remove the entire plant unless it is totally covered. | Provide adequate fertilizer. With proper nutrition, pepper plants can actually fight off the bacteria. As with humans, the more healthy we are, the more able we are to fight off bacteria quickly. Feed any affected plants with an all-purpose fertilizer at the recommended frequency. Remember, too much fertilizer is a bad thing, too, as high salts in the soil can lead to worse disease issues. | Spray with natural fungicide. Although leaf spot is bacterial, fungal treatments have been known to help. Use a copper based fungicide as a foliar spray in the early morning or late evening to help reduce the spread. | Avoid wetting the leaves when watering. Water is necessary for the spores to multiply and spread on your pepper plant's leaves. Always water at the base of the plant to avoid splashing water onto the leaves. | Practice cleanly gardening. As with all bacterial and viral pathogens, it is important to be cleanly while in the garden. If possible, use gloves when handling your plants. Avoid touching all of the plants, one after the other to reduce the spread of spores.",https://peppergeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pepper-Plant-Leaf-Spot-735x490.jpg.webp
