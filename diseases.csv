Mosaic Virus,"Mosaic viruses can be seed borne or soil borne and are spread by sap sucking insects such as aphids. They can also be spread by contact of infected plants, and are most problematic in dry weather.",Green and yellow mottled leaves | Prickly or bumpy surface on fruits | Stunted growth | Low pepper production,"Remove affected plants. There are no effective treatments for viruses. If you suspect mosaic virus, remove the pepper plants from the garden and burn them if possible. The fruits are still safe to eat, but the seeds can carry the virus, so do not save seeds from affected fruits. Keep the pests at bay. Mosaic viruses are commonly spread by sap sucking insects such as aphids. Use a pure neem oil solution with castile soap and water and spray plants to deal with these pests. | Keep the weeds under control. Weeds can carry mosaic virus, and can also be a breeding ground for the insects that spread it. Use a ground cover, or at least keep the weeds at bay with a weeding hoe (these are great for saving your back). | Avoid touching plants. Always wash your hands before and after gardening. Your hands can be the vehicle to transfer viral pathogens from one plant to another. Also, avoid smoking in your garden, as this can introduce mosaic virus to the soil. | Plant resistant pepper varieties. Some varieties have been identified to be more resistant to tobacco mosaic virus, though none are resistant to cucumber mosaic and other viruses. Look for varieties that are labeled 'TMV' (tobacco mosaic virus resistant) at nurseries and garden centers. Some common types are sweet banana, super cayenne, and bell boy hybrid.",https://peppergeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Mosaic-Virus-Pepper-Plant-sm.jpg.webp
Blight,"Phytophthora blight is a pepper plant disease that is spread by a soil-borne pathogen. If your pepper plants have leaves low on the main stem, the rainfall can cause the soil to splash up on to the foliage, introducing the disease. | There are more than one type of blight, usually categorized into 'early blight' and 'late blight.' Symptoms are similar, but some are more common in different parts of the world at different times of the growing season.","Large, brown leaf spots and wilting | Brown or black stems at base of plant | Root rot (leading to plant death) | Fruit rot (when in contact with infected soil)","Plant your peppers in a raised bed or in pots to improve drainage. Blight is most commonly found in in-ground gardens or fields. Rainfall will have less time to sit on the surface of the soil and spread the pathogen in a raised bed or a potted plant. | If you can't use a raised bed or pot, try mounding up the soil around each plant to avoid standing water at the base of the plants. | Another step to take is to use a mulch, such as straw, grass clippings, or black tarp. Mulching helps prevent splashing from the soil onto your pepper plant's leaves when it rains. It also has other benefits like improved water retention and subduing weeds. | If it is dry, do not over-water your garden. Standing water is the only way that blight mold spores can multiply and spread. Wherever the infected water flows, the spores will follow. | Always acquire your soil and/or compost from trustworthy sources. Bringing infected soil into the garden is the easiest way to end up with this pepper plant problem.",https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/spai/w_620+q_lossless+ret_img+to_webp/https://doraagri.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/early-blight.jpg
Bacterial Leaf Spot,"Bacterial leaf spot is a common bacterial plant infection seen all around the world. It is most common in rainy, humid, and temperate climates. These are the environmental conditions in which the bacteria can spread most easily. | Leaf spot is a bacteria, so it can be spread by touch, through seeds, or via soil. Use cleanly soil and watering practices to avoid splashing the leaves with soil or cross contaminating.","Yellow and green spots on leaves | Brown spots on leaves in later stages | Raised, corky spots on peppers | Leaf drop and decaying peppers","Remove infected parts. As with pepper plants infected with viruses, you should remove parts of the plant that show signs of leaf spot. The bacteria can spread easily, especially under damp and hot conditions. You don't need to remove the entire plant unless it is totally covered. | Provide adequate fertilizer. With proper nutrition, pepper plants can actually fight off the bacteria. As with humans, the more healthy we are, the more able we are to fight off bacteria quickly. Feed any affected plants with an all-purpose fertilizer at the recommended frequency. Remember, too much fertilizer is a bad thing, too, as high salts in the soil can lead to worse disease issues. | Spray with natural fungicide. Although leaf spot is bacterial, fungal treatments have been known to help. Use a copper based fungicide as a foliar spray in the early morning or late evening to help reduce the spread. | Avoid wetting the leaves when watering. Water is necessary for the spores to multiply and spread on your pepper plant's leaves. Always water at the base of the plant to avoid splashing water onto the leaves. | Practice cleanly gardening. As with all bacterial and viral pathogens, it is important to be cleanly while in the garden. If possible, use gloves when handling your plants. Avoid touching all of the plants, one after the other to reduce the spread of spores.",https://peppergeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pepper-Plant-Leaf-Spot-735x490.jpg.webp
Early Blight,"Early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani. Early blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85˚F.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked.","Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a bull's eye"" pattern. As the disease matures","Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems. | Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut. | Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation. | Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry. | For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed. | Remove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year. | Burn or bag infected plant parts. Do NOT compost.",https://www.planetnatural.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/potato-blight.jpg
Late Blight,"Late blight first appears on the lower, older leaves as water-soaked, gray-green spots. As the disease matures, these spots darken and a white fungal growth forms on the undersides. Eventually the entire plant will become infected. True to its name, the disease occurs later in the growing season with symptoms often not appearing until after blossom. Unlike other fungal diseases, this plant problem does not overwinter in the soil or on garden trash. Instead the spores are introduced by infected tubers, transplants or seeds. Wind will also carry the disease from nearby gardens. Warm temperatures (70-80˚F) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread.","Late blight first appears on the lower, older leaves as water-soaked, gray-green spots. As the disease matures, these spots darken and a white fungal growth forms on the undersides. Eventually the entire plant will become infected.","Plant resistant cultivars when available. | Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough apart to allow for plenty of air circulation. | Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses, to give plants time to dry out during the day - avoid overhead irrigation. | Destroy all debris after harvest. | Apply a copper based fungicide (2 oz/ gallon of water) every 7 days or less, following heavy rain or when the amount of disease is increasing rapidly. If possible, time applications so that at least 12 hours of dry weather follows application.",https://www.planetnatural.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/late-blight-tomato.jpg
Leaf Spot,"Pathogen-caused leaf spot diseases, particularly those of stone fruit trees and such vegetables as tomato, pepper and lettuce are of two types, those caused by bacteria and those caused by fungus. Leaf spotting of either kind is generally similar in appearance and effect.","Infected plants have brown or black water-soaked spots on the foliage, sometimes with a yellow halo, usually uniform in size. The spots enlarge and will run together under wet conditions. Under dry conditions the spots have a speckled appearance. As spots become more numerous, entire leaves may yellow, wither and drop. Members of the Prunus family (stone fruits, including cherry, plum, almond, apricot and peach) are particularly susceptible to bacterial leaf spot. The fruit may appear spotted or have sunken brown areas. Bacterial leaf spot will also attack tomato and pepper crops in vegetable gardens.","When selecting fruit trees, choose resistant varieties if possible. | Keep the soil under the tree clean and rake up fallen fruit. | Use a thick layer of mulch to cover the soil after you have raked and cleaned it well. Mulch will reduce weeds and prevent the disease pathogen from splashing back up onto the leaves. | Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation. Make sure to disinfect your pruning equipment (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut. | Leaf spot among vegetables is most often introduced through infected seed or transplants. Make sure your seeds and transplants are from leaf spot-free stock.  | There is no cure for plants infected with bacterial leaf spot. Preventive, organic measures include: | Spraying with a baking soda solution (a tablespoon of baking soda, 2 1/2 tablespoons of vegetable oil, a teaspoon of liquid soap, not detergent, to one gallon of water), or neem oil (do not use when pollinating insects including bees or other beneficial insects are present). Baking soda may burn some plant leaves. Spray only a few and then check for a reaction before applying applications every two weeks. | Apply sulfur sprays or copper-based fungicides weekly at first sign of disease to prevent its spread. These organic fungicides will not kill leaf spot, but prevent the spores from germinating.",https://www.planetnatural.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/leaf-spot-fungus.jpg
Mild Mottle Virus,Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV) is a plant virus that occurs worldwide and infects capsicums and some other solanaceous plants. The virus is easily spread by contact. Seed transmission can also occur.,"Like its name suggests the virus often produces mild symptoms on leaves of infected capsicum and chilli plants, however in some varieties leaf symptoms may be absent. Symptoms on capsicum fruit, including blistering and necrosis, can cause loss of marketability. The virus readily infects capsicum and chill, and can also infect tomato and eggplant.","Use only healthy seeds and seedlings as the virus can easily be introduced from contaminated sources. | Capsicum varieties are available with resistance to the virus, which may be suitable to reduce its impact on farms where it is present. | Prevent movement of equipment and machinery between farms and between production areas. Ensure all visitors and workers use footbaths each time they enter. | Surfaces, tools and hands can be cleaned by removing dirt first with water and followed with a 20% non-fat dry milk powder solution which is safe and effective. Other disinfectants (e.g. bleach and virkon) can work also.  Change solutions daily or when heavily contaminated with soil or plant material to ensure the solution can work. | Infected plantings should be destroyed and buried as well as all contaminated material including wooden stakes in an area which is not used for cropping. | Remove old finished crops and avoid carryover of plants between growing seasons as many may act as infection sources to new crops. Weeds including nightshade can host the virus and should be destroyed as well. | Rotate plantings and do not plant susceptible plants into areas infected with the virus last year. Melons, pumpkins and zucchini are not affected by the virus and can be used in rotation with capsicum and tomatoes in infected areas. | Do not move people, equipment from older plantings to younger plantings. Clean equipment, including hands and footwear before commencing work.",https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/sites/gateway/files/styles/portrait_large/public/IMG_0964_edited.jpg?itok=-tqqMz3_
